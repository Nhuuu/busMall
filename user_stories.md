BusMall is a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel. BusMall catalogs are placed on Puget Sound regional transit system buses… whose overall travel times are now comparable to cross-country flights, after all. Since catalogs are expensive to print and distribute, and the products cost money to make and warehouse, and BusMall is a lean startup that needs to carefully watch its expenditures, BusMall wants to feature only the items in its catalog that are the most likely to sell. This means that BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest… before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.

## Marketing research team
As a Marketing Resarch Team, I want to know the total number of clicks for a product chosen by the Focus Group Participants and a percentage of times that an item was clicked when shown.

## Developer
As a developer, I want to randomly display set of 3 product images to the user, allow the user to pick from the 3, then provide data of how many times the products were clicked. 

As a developer, randomly displayed images cannot be duplicates, and cannot be used in the next cycle. 

As a developer, I want to show a percentage of times that image was clicked by the user when shown.

## Focus group participant
As a Focus Group Participant, I want to choose a product from list of 3 product images shown on screen so that I can see what my most favorite product is in comparison to all the products I've looked through in the catalog.
